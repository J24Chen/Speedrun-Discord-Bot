KEEP THE LEADBOARD URLS


instead add to it doing this:
f"https://www.speedrun.com/api/v1/leaderboards/{id}/level/{level}/{category}?var-gnx39zxn=10v02y5l"


TO IMPLEMENT VARIABLE MENUS

Make user select the variable to choose from:
From the same function, grab the list of values and allow users to select the ones they want 
(PERFORM THIS IN THE getwr FUNCTION??)

I think it might be best to make a separate function to get a list of variable options for the variable

Then in the getwr function, make a "varis" variable is a dictionary that contains the value 

Can be done like 

vari = {}
vari['VARCATEGORY'] = 'VARVALUE'


for i in vari:
    print(i + vari[i])
